    <description>Fishcom is a tool that can render graphics on any console. It's written in C# and powered by .NET Standard.

The idea came from me watching a guy make a graphics card out of breadboards. Not having te resources to do that myself I decided to make a graphics engine using a concept he utlised in his project (writing pixels from left to right top to bottom). At first it started simple but I kept adding stuff and it kept "growing".

This is the result.</description>
